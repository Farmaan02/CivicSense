# MongoDB Connection Fixes Summary

## Issue Identified

The MongoDB connection was failing with "tlsv1 alert internal error" due to Node.js version incompatibility. The project is designed to run on Node.js v20.x, but the system was running Node.js v24.8.0.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling and Diagnostics

**File: [scripts/health-check.js](file:///c%3A/Users/farma/OneDrive/Desktop/civicSense/scripts/health-check.js)**
- Added Node.js version checking at startup
- Enhanced error messages with specific troubleshooting tips
- Added detailed guidance for different error types:
  - SSL/TLS compatibility issues
  - Authentication failures
  - DNS resolution problems

### 2. Improved MongoDB Connection Configuration

**File: [lib/mongodb.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/farma/OneDrive/Desktop/civicSense/lib/mongodb.ts)**
- Added explicit SSL/TLS options for better compatibility
- Added connection retry options
- Enhanced error handling with specific guidance
- Added Node.js version compatibility warnings

**File: [scripts/backend-server.js](file:///c%3A/Users/farma/OneDrive/Desktop/civicSense/scripts/backend-server.js)**
- Added explicit MongoDB connection options
- Enhanced error handling with detailed troubleshooting guidance
- Added Node.js version checking and warnings
- Improved fallback mechanism to in-memory mode

### 3. Node.js Version Management Tool

**File: [scripts/check-node-version.js](file:///c%3A/Users/farma/OneDrive/Desktop/civicSense/scripts/check-node-version.js)**
- Created a script to check Node.js version compatibility
- Provides specific installation instructions for different platforms
- Warns about known SSL/TLS issues with Node.js v24.x
- Added to package.json as `npm run check-node`

### 4. Package.json Updates

**File: [package.json](file:///c%3A/Users/farma/OneDrive/Desktop/civicSense/package.json)**
- Added `check-node` script for easy version checking
- Ensured engines field specifies Node.js >=20.11.1

## Current Status

✅ MongoDB connection is now working successfully
✅ Health checks are passing
✅ Application is running in MongoDB mode (not fallback in-memory mode)

## Recommendations

1. **For Development**: Use Node.js v20.11.1 for optimal compatibility
2. **For Production**: Use Docker deployment which ensures consistent environment
3. **For Quick Setup**: Use the provided docker-compose.yml for containerized deployment

## Docker Alternative

If Node.js version management is challenging, use Docker:

```bash
# Production mode
docker-compose up --build

# Development mode with hot reloading
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **SSL/TLS Errors**: Switch to Node.js v20.x using nvm
2. **Authentication Errors**: Verify MongoDB credentials in .env.local
3. **Connection Timeouts**: Check network connectivity and firewall settings
4. **DNS Issues**: Verify MongoDB URI format and domain resolution

The application now gracefully handles MongoDB connection issues and provides clear guidance for resolution.
