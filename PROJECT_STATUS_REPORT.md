# CivicPulse Project Status Report

## Current Status

✅ **Project is functioning correctly with no critical errors**

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Dotenv Module Issue
- **Problem**: The health check script was failing with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for dotenv
- **Root Cause**: Dotenv was listed in package.json but not properly installed in the node_modules
- **Fix**: Ran `npm install dotenv` to properly install the missing dependency
- **Verification**: Health check now runs successfully

### 2. Environment Variable Loading
- **Problem**: Environment variables were not being loaded properly in some cases
- **Root Cause**: Dotenv package needed to be explicitly installed
- **Fix**: Ensured dotenv is properly installed and configured
- **Verification**: All critical environment variables (JWT_SECRET, MONGODB_URI) are now loading correctly

## Current Health Status

2. **Configure CI/CD**: Set up automated testing and deployment
3. **Monitor Logs**: Implement proper logging for production
4. **Security Audits**: Regularly review security practices
5. **Performance Testing**: Conduct load testing for production deployment
