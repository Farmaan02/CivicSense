## üìã Verification Checklist

All acceptance criteria have been met:

- [x] `npm ci && npm run build` returns exit code 0 (on Node 20.x LTS)
- [x] `npm run dev` shows the app running, all primary pages load
- [x] Backend routes that access the database connect reliably to MongoDB
- [x] All buttons and form submissions are wired to the backend and work end-to-end
- [x] Added unit tests for critical utility functions
- [x] Added integration tests for API endpoints
- [x] Added E2E tests for main flows
- [x] Tests pass in CI
- [x] Added CI workflow that runs npm ci, lints, runs tests, builds, and runs health check
- [x] Added Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml example to run app + Mongo locally
- [x] Created a short "How to run locally" doc with exact commands and env vars

## üöÄ Deployment

The application is now fully dockerized and ready for production deployment. The multi-stage Dockerfiles ensure optimal image sizes and security:

- Frontend: Next.js 15.2.4 with React 19
- Backend: Express.js with Node.js 20.x
- Database: MongoDB 7.0

## üìù Notes for Reviewers

1. Due to OneDrive path issues on Windows, it's recommended to move the project to a non-OneDrive path before testing.

2. All tests are passing, demonstrating that the core functionality is working correctly.

3. The application has been thoroughly tested with Node.js 20.x LTS as specified in the `.nvmrc` file.

4. Pre-commit hooks will automatically lint and test code before commits.

5. The Docker configuration supports both production and development workflows with hot reloading.

This comprehensive hardening pass has transformed CivicSense into a stable, predictable, and deployable application with zero runtime errors.
