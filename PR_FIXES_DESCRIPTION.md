2. `npm run build` - Build completes with exit code 0

### Local Development
1. `npm run dev` - App runs without runtime console errors
2. All primary pages load correctly:
   - Landing page
   - Report modal
   - Interactive map
   - Reports dashboard
   - Login/signup flows

### Backend & Database
1. Backend routes connect reliably to MongoDB using `MONGODB_URI`
2. Connection and reconnection errors are handled gracefully
3. All buttons and form submissions work end-to-end

### Testing
1. Unit tests for critical utility functions pass
2. Integration tests for API endpoints pass
3. E2E tests for main flows pass
4. All tests pass in CI environment

### Docker Deployment
1. `docker build -t civicsense:latest .` - Docker build succeeds
2. `docker-compose up` - App and MongoDB boot correctly
3. API can connect to database in Docker environment

## Known Issues & Recommendations

### OneDrive Path Issues
The project should not be run from a OneDrive folder as it may cause `EINVAL readlink` errors on Windows. Move the project to a non-OneDrive path (e.g., `~/projects/civicsense`) before running.

### Node.js Version
Ensure you're using Node.js 20.x LTS as specified in `.nvmrc`. Using other versions may cause compatibility issues.
