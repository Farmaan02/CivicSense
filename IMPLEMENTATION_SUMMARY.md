## Known Issues & Recommendations

### OneDrive Path Issues
The project should not be run from a OneDrive folder as it may cause `EINVAL readlink` errors on Windows. Move the project to a non-OneDrive path (e.g., `~/projects/civicsense`) before running.

### Node.js Version
Ensure you're using Node.js 20.x LTS as specified in `.nvmrc`. Using other versions may cause compatibility issues.
