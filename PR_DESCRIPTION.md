## Notes for Reviewers

Due to OneDrive path issues on Windows, it's recommended to move the project to a non-OneDrive path before testing. The project has been thoroughly tested with Node.js 20.x LTS as specified in the `.nvmrc` file.

All tests are now passing, including:
- Frontend unit tests
- Backend API integration tests
- Form validation tests
- Authentication tests
- File upload tests
- Notification system tests

The application is now fully dockerized with separate services for frontend, backend, and MongoDB, and includes both production and development docker-compose configurations.
